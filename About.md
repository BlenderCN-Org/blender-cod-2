Create models and animations for CoD using free Blender and Blender-CoD addon (without Maya)!

## Introduction ##

Getting new 3D content into Call of Duty games can be expensive, because the official mod tools only include plugins for the commercial 3d modelling software [Maya](http://usa.autodesk.com/maya/) by Autodesk (former Alias). With this addon, you can do it for free!


## Blender-CoD Add-On ##

Blender-CoD is a **free**, **open-source** project and provides a plugin for the as well free and open-source **3D modelling software [Blender](http://www.blender.org/)**.

It adds support for XMODEL\_EXPORT v5/v6 and XANIM\_EXPORT v3 formats, which can be compiled to xmodels and xanims using the mod tools. All CoD titles are supported for export (Blender -> Asset Manager -> Call of Duty).

You can basically import any supported 3d model into Blender (e.g. Blender files, Wavefront OBJ, Collada DAE, 3ds Max 3DS and more), edit it and finally export it for CoD using the Blender-CoD Add-On.
